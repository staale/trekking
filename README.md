# Brunch with Ember Reloaded

A [Brunch](http://brunch.io) skeleton for creating ambitious web applications using [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com). Based on the official Ember [Starter Kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit/archive/master.zip).

## Demo

I built a demo app using this skeleton, based on the [Building an App with Ember.js](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga99hMi7wfY) video by [Tom Dale](http://twitter.com/tomdale).

**Demo**: [ember-bloggr](http://dev.gcollazo.com/ember-bloggr)

**Source**: [https://github.com/gcollazo/ember-bloggr](https://github.com/gcollazo/ember-bloggr)

## Versions
- [Ember v1.1.2](http://emberjs.com)
- [Ember Data v1.0.0-beta.3-2-ga01195b](https://github.com/emberjs/data)
- [Handlebars 1.1.2](http://handlebarsjs.com)
- [jQuery v2.0.3](http://jquery.com)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate v4.2.0](http://html5boilerplate.com)

## Features

- **Stylus** - Expressive, dynamic, robust CSS pre-processor.
- **auto-reload-brunch** - Adds automatic browser reloading support to brunch.
- **uglify-js-brunch** - Adds UglifyJS support to brunch.

## Getting started

Before using brunch-with-ember-reloaded you will need to install [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/).

```
brunch new gh:gcollazo/brunch-with-ember-reloaded <appname>
cd <appname>
brunch watch -s
```
Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) on your browser.

## Generators

This skeleton makes use of [scaffolt](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme) generators to help you create common files quicker. To use first install scaffolt globally with `npm install -g scaffolt`. Then you can use the following command to generate files.

```
scaffolt model <name>             →    app/models/Name.coffee
scaffolt view <name>              →    app/views/NameView.coffee
scaffolt controller <name>        →    app/controllers/NameController.coffee
scaffolt arraycontroller <name>	  →    app/controllers/NamesController.coffee
scaffolt route <name>             →    app/routes/NameRoute.coffee
scaffolt template <name>          →    app/templatesname.hbs
scaffolt component <name>         →    app/components/NameComponent.coffee
                                       app/templates/components/name.hbs
```

There are more commands you can do with scaffolt and also instruction on how to create your own generators, so make sure you check out the [docs](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme).

## Testing

To run you will need [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner) you will need to install [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs). If you want to run your tests on other browsers consult the Karma docs.

```
brew update && brew install phantomjs
```

To run tests continiously as you write code and tests (for now) you must open two terminal windows.

```
brunch watch -s
```

```
karma start
```
